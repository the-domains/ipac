data-reactid="61"><h1>Importance of IPAC in Day Care Centres</h1><p><strong>Over the recent decades, there has been an increased demand for child care in Canada. According to Statistics Canada, 54% of parents with children aged 4 and under and 39% of parents with children over the age of 5 used day cares. (1)</strong></p><p><strong>Child care centers and their operators play a crucial role in supporting the healthy development of children. Research in the field of early childhood education has shown that a high quality of child care enhances a childâ€™s social and cognitive development. (2)</strong></p><p><strong>Although there are definite benefits to the use of child care, the practice is not absent from risk. Evidence has shown that day care attendance increases a childâ€™s risk of acquiring common infectious diseases compared to children cared for at home. (3)</strong></p><p><strong>Due to the increased risk of infection, immature immune systems, and poor personal hygiene practices among children, it is crucial that day care operators utilize effective infection control practices in order to protect the health of the children, their families, and the community as a whole.</strong></p><p><strong>The following article looks at five infections control practices that are effective in reducing the incidence of infectious diseases in this vulnerable population.</strong></p><h1>Donning, Doffing, and Hand Washing</h1><p><strong>Hand washing is one of the most effective methods to reduce disease transmission. The hands of both children and operators pick up organisms from contaminated surfaces. Without proper hand washing, these germs can be transmitted to other people, food, or various surfaces.</strong></p><p><strong>It is crucial for infection control in day cares that children are educated on frequent hand washing using the correct steps. The operators of day cares must also practice frequent hand washing as they often perform hazardous practices such as diaper changes and food preparation.</strong></p><p><strong>Certain situations such as a body fluid spills in day cares call for additional infection control practices with the use of personal protective equipment (PPE). Although PPE offers protection against infection, it is only effective if the equipment is put on and taken off in the appropriate steps.</strong></p><h2>Resources</h2><p><strong>Hand washing procedure poster :</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.wdgpublichealth.ca/sites/default/files/wdgphfiles/Handwashing%20with%20soap%20and%20water%20-%20Mar%2011%202015.pdf">https://www.wdgpublichealth.ca/sites/default/files/wdgphfiles/Handwashing%20with%20soap%20and%20water%20-%20Mar%2011%202015.pdf</a></p><p><strong>Information on the appropriate use of PPE</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.wdgpublichealth.ca/?q=hpltcicp">https://www.wdgpublichealth.ca/?q=hpltcicp</a></p><p><strong>Diaper Changing Routine Procedures</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.wdgpublichealth.ca/sites/default/files/wdgphfiles/Diaper%20Changing%20Routine%20Fact%20Sheet%20HPDCD(FS)60.pdf">https://www.wdgpublichealth.ca/sites/default/files/wdgphfiles/Diaper%20Changing%20Routine%20Fact%20Sheet%20HPDCD(FS)60.pdf</a></p><p><strong>Detailed information on the use of PPE and dangers associated with misuse</strong></p><p><a href="http://www.publichealthontario.ca/en/eRepository/RPAP_All_HealthCare_Settings_Eng2012.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">publichealthontario.ca/en/eRepository/RPAP_All_HealthCare_Settings_Eng2012.pdf</a></p><h1>Food Safety</h1><p><strong>Food may be a potential carrier of disease in day cares. Safe food handling practices are essential in maintaining the health of the children who attend day care.</strong></p><p><strong>Food handlers in child care centres must meet the provincial requirements for food safety. Factors such as safe cooking temperatures, safe food storage, facility maintenance, frequent cleaning and disinfection of premises and utensils, as well as hand hygiene all contribute to the reduction of infections associated with food. Refer to the regulatory document in the resource list below for a comprehensive list of food safety practices.</strong></p><p><strong>It is important that operators are knowledgeable on the topic of food safety in order to protect the health of the children they are caring for. The Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Health Unit offers a Food Safety Training and Certification that will allow you to become fluent in the practices of safe food handling.</strong></p><p><strong>Furthermore, it is important to only prepare food that has been prepared, packaged, and transported in a safe manner. The Canadian Food Inspection agency maintains an up to date list of recalled food items as well as information about food recalls that should be referenced prior to purchasing food for day care use.</strong></p><h2>Resources</h2><p><strong>Food Safetry Training and Certification</strong></p><p><a href="http://www.wdgpublichealth.ca/?q=businessfoodcert">http://www.wdgpublichealth.ca/?q=businessfoodcert</a></p><p><strong>Canadian Food Inspection Agency Food Recall Warnings</strong></p><p><a href="http://www.inspection.gc.ca/about-the-cfia/newsroom/food-recall-warnings/eng/1299076382077/1299076493846" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">inspection.gc.ca/about-the-cfia/newsroom/food-recall-warnings/eng/1299076382077/1299076493846</a></p><p><strong>Provincial Regulatory Food Safety Standards</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.ontario.ca/laws/regulation/900562">https://www.ontario.ca/laws/regulation/900562</a></p><p><strong>Food safety hazard analysis and critical control point document</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.wdgpublichealth.ca/sites/default/files/wdgphfiles/haccp%20food%20safety%20booklet.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wdgpublichealth.ca/sites/default/files/wdgphfiles/haccp%20food%20safety%20booklet.pdf</a></p><h1>Immunization</h1><p><strong>Up to date immunization is critical in the prevention infectious disease acquisition by stopping infections before they start. Immunization programs in Canada are a major factor in the reduction in child mortality seen over the last century.</strong></p><p><strong>It is important that both children and day care operators are vaccinated according to their age in order to receive protection against diseases. Appropriate vaccination against infectious diseases impacts the health of not only the individuals but also the community by reducing transmission.</strong></p><p><strong>The provincial Day Nurseries Act states that a complete history of a childâ€™s immunization history is submitted to public health. Furthermore, child care staff must meet similar requirements and have an up to date vaccination history prior to starting employment in a child care setting.</strong></p><h2>Resources</h2><p><strong>Immunization clinic locations</strong></p><p><a href="http://www.wdgpublichealth.ca/?q=cliniclocations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wdgpublichealth.ca/?q=cliniclocations</a></p><p><strong>Ontarioâ€™s Routine Immunization Schedule</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONThealth/app/?sk=app_501877329898439&ref=page_internal" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">facebook.com/ONThealth/app/?sk=app_501877329898439&amp;ref=page_internal</a></p><p><strong>Ontario Day Nurseries Act</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.ontario.ca/laws/regulation/900262" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ontario.ca/laws/regulation/900262</a></p><h1>Cleaning and Disinfection</h1><p><strong>The surfaces in day cares are constantly being contaminated with various organisms present in the environment, the hands of children or operators, and other sources.</strong></p><p><strong>Frequent and appropriate methods of cleaning and disinfection reduce the presence of bacteria in the environment, thus reducing the risk of infection.</strong></p><p><strong>Certain viruses and bacteria may survive on surfaces for extended periods of time and it best to assume that no surface is clean unless proper cleaning and disinfection procedures have been followed.</strong></p><p><strong>In order to safeguard the health of all people present in day care centers, a comprehensive cleaning and disinfection program must be present. When developing the policies and procedures for cleaning and disinfection, ensure to identify the areas that need attention, the frequency of practice, use appropriate cleaners and disinfectants, and practice the correct steps.</strong></p><p><strong>Certain surfaces, such as plush toys or porous surfaces cannot be cleaned and disinfected appropriately. In order to keep such items safe, they must be used on a rotational basis. Items that cannot be cleaned must be kept out of the child care areas for two weeks before being reintroduced to the children, safeguarding against exposure to pathogens.</strong></p><h2>Resources</h2><p><strong>Nature Based Play in Childcare Centres</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.wdgpublichealth.ca/sites/default/files/wdgphfiles/Nature%20Based%20Play%20in%20Childcare%20Centres%20HPDCD(FS)62%20(2015-09-24).pdf">https://www.wdgpublichealth.ca/sites/default/files/wdgphfiles/Nature%20Based%20Play%20in%20Childcare%20Centres%20HPDCD(FS)62%20(2015-09-24).pdf</a></p><p><strong>Nature Based Play Schedule for Child Care Centres</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.wdgpublichealth.ca/sites/default/files/wdgphfiles/Nature%20Based%20Play%20Schedule%20for%20Child%20Care%20Centres%20(2016-01-09).pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wdgpublichealth.ca/sites/default/files/wdgphfiles/Nature%20Based%20Play%20Schedule%20for%20Child%20Care%20Centres%20(2016-01-09).pdf</a></p><p><strong>Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning</strong></p><h1>Policies and Procedures</h1><p><strong>Policies and procedures documents are critical in day care settings because they ensure that all staff become trained and educated on the procedures and risks present in their work environment.</strong></p><p><strong>Policies and procedures should be reviewed annually to keep them current with best practices and submitted to the local public health unit for review.</strong></p><p><strong>Of particular importance are policies and procedures relating to exclusion of ill staff and children, infection control practices, environmental cleaning, food safety, and outbreak management.</strong></p><p><strong>Lapses during critical moments of infection control, such as during a bodily fluid cleanup or management of an outbreak may have serious consequences. Inadequate preparation and training in these areas of infection control may not only pose a health risk to the individual but all the children present in the child care center or even the whole community.</strong></p><p><strong>Comprehensive infection control policies and procedures ensure that when stressful situations occur, all staff are not only prepared to take action but doing so in the appropriate way.</strong></p><h1>References</h1><p><strong>(1) <a href="http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/89-652-x/89-652-x2014005-eng.htm">http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/89-652-x/89-652-x2014005-eng.htm</a></strong></p><p><strong>(2) <a href="http://nieer.org/sites/nieer/files/Investing%20in%20Early%20Childhood%20Eduation%20A%20Global%20Perspectivei.pdf">http://nieer.org/sites/nieer/files/Investing%20in%20Early%20Childhood%20Eduation%20A%20Global%20Perspectivei.pdf</a></strong></p><p><strong>(3) <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15191427">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15191427</a>).</strong></p></div></article></section></div><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="62"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="63"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="64"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="65"><span data-reactid="66"><!-- react-empty: 67 --><h2 data-reactid="68"><a data-reactid="69">IPAC</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="70"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="71"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="72"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="73"></div></section></div></div>
