# About Me

Your Health Inspector for Dufferin County.

My name is Kosta. I am a health inspector working for the Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Health unit who is responsible for inspections of Day Nurseries in Dufferin County.

I have created this website to allow for discourse and encourage communication between the health unit, myself, and day care operators with the goal of improving the health of the children and the community.

If you are a day care operator and have any questions relating to health and safety in your premises, feel free to contact me using the information below.
