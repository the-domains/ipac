# About Me

Your Health Inspector for Dufferin County.

My name is Kosta.

I am a health inspector working for the Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Health Unit.

I am responsible for inspections of Day Nurseries, Long-Term Care Homes, and Personal Service Settings in Dufferin County.

I have created this website to allow for discourse and encourage communication between the health unit, myself, and day care operators.

The goal of this website is to improve the health of children and the community through the practice of appropriate infection prevention and control practices.

If you are a day care operator and have any questions relating to health and safety in your premises, feel free to contact me using the information below.
